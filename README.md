# splitting-and-merging-in-cv
an image is represented by three components: a Red, Green, and Blue channel.
I do access each individual Red, Green, and Blue channel of an image
Load an input image from disk
Split it into its respective Red, Green, and Blue channels
Display each channel onto our screen for visualization purposes
Merge the individual channels back together to form the original image
